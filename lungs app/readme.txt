here we have to predict a person having lungs cancer or not by considering factor like age,areaq,drinking of alkohol and smokes.
i tried to build model with pycaret package performance of model was good ,as it is new i am unable to implement it in production,then i go through traditional sklearn method
.but without using flask and django i used streamlit package,less code ,we can put html inside the file.then it was succesful
within days i am looking for some more knowledge about pycaret then any one can deploy a model to production in a hour.
